  ## üö´ Restriction of Admin

  - Can not create blog
  - can not update any blog

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technology I have used:

- **npm**: I used npm (Node Packege Manager) to easily install, update, and manage the required packages and libraries in the project.
- **Express.js**: For server-side development.
- **MongoDB**: Database used for storing data.
- **Mongoose**: Used for database validation.
- **TypeScript**: Programming language used for type safety and better code maintainability.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **cors**: For handling cross-origin requests and security.
- **nodemon**: For auto-restarting the server after code changes.
- **zod**: For data validation.
- **zod**: For data validation.
- **Bcrypt**: For secure user password.
- **jwt**: For authetication loging user and authorization give access to user to do specific operation.
- **vercel**: For deploying the code to a cloud server.
- **MongoDB Compass**: For check database more fast.
- **No sql booster**: For check mongodb query.

## üèπ Validate information:

### Authetication

For authentication I used jwt. by jwt a login user get a token for his enity or existance. According to jwt he can do operation which have his access. Without token he can not perform.
Without login if a user is hit api , he will get a error message as reponse

### Authorization

For User and Admin specific role I used authorization by jwt token. Admin can do some high securated work that why for check logged user is simple user or admin I used authorization which is performed by jwt token. And if Any simple user want to hit admin api he will get a error message by response

## üì¢ Error messgae:

User will get error message as response for these type of error

- ZOD_ERROR
- NOT_FOUND_ERROR
- VALIDATION_ERROR
- AUTH_ERROR
- AUTHORIZATION_ERROR
- INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
